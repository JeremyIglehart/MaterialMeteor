# Material UI and Meteor

This is a basic project to prove that Material UI and Meteor can work together.  I was having problems getting the `@next` version of Material UI to work with my other project, so this is really just a test.

Meanwhile, React Router updated - and completely changed the API (Thanks guys!) I'm excited to see how this changes my programming style.  But for now, at least I got it working.
